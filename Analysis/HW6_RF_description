Model description of Random Forest:
- The random forest model is a popular machine-learning algorithm comprised of multiple decision trees. 
- Within each individual decision tree are decision nodes. 
- The purpose of decision trees are to see how to subset the data through CART (Classification and Regression Tree). 
- Because decision trees are supervised, be cautious of bias and overfitting. 
- With the RF model, it's important to have multiple decision trees in order to obtain the most accurate results. 

RF comparison to GWR model:
- NOTE: Our group is still working on how to properly fit our data set with the GWR model. 
- A noteable difference between RF and GWR is that RF is able to better capture any non-linear relationships compared to regression models. 
- The RF model also weighs certain features more than others, whereas the GWR model does not.
