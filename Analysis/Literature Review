******* STRENGTHS *******

1) Risk prediction models 
2) Studies also have a wide range of covariates 
3) Following studies identify clusters using bandwidths and statistics such as Moran's I, LISA, Getis-Ord Gi, etc. 
4) By pooling the data over multiple years, this reduces the amount of missing information from smaller counties 


******* WEAKNESSES *******

1) When using GWR model, multicollinearity is subject to occur. 
2) Spatial and temporal differences on the larger regional/subregional scale is still poorly understood 
3) Hosptilization weaknesses and findings from studies show that there's a misclassification of races outside of white/black. This often happens due to underrreporting.
This suggests the need for better accurate population-based surveillance on races to

1. Zelko paper:
- Variables: Type 2 diabetes mortality rates, air pollution, social determinants, and county-level data 
- Correlation found between household income, race, and healthcare access 
- CDC and Wonder data, cohort study, age-adjusted CVM, GWR model, AIC and R^2
- Results show that counties in the South had the highest PM2.5 exposure and counties in the Northeast had the lowest 

2. Terry paper:
- Foused on race/sex differences rather than geographical differences 
- Results suggest an association between the social determinants of health and cardiovascular mortality
- Wonder data, Social Vulnerability Index, 2-tailed Kruskal-Wallis test, linear regression model 

3. Singh paper:
- Examined CVD on the elderly population using hospitalization records; specifically data from 1991-2014, aged 65+ years, and categorized by 
age/sex/race/state
- Performed data standardization 
- Divided the data into batches (differences in algorithms for certain year ranges), 3rd degree polynomial function

4. Tabb paper:
- Variables: smoking status, BMI, physical activity, blood pressure, blood glocuse levels, and diet 
- Focus on how much heterogeneity exists in the difference between whites and blacks in the US
- GWR model, ANOVA F test, adaptive bandwidths 

5. Mena paper:
- Mapping, cluster detection, spatial regression 
- Detailed sections of the factors associated with cardiovascular disease such as air pollution, socioeconomic status, education level, 
rural vs urban residency, etc 
- States that socioeconomic status is an important factor to see access to healthcare services 


******* LITERATURE REVIEW KEY HIGHLIGHTS *******

1) Above papers are useful for our paper to see the spatial distribution of cardiovascular disease and better understand the geographical differrences 
in relation to air quality and socioeconomic factors on a spatial and temporal basis. This allows policymakers to make the necessary decisions and implement policies.

2) Past studies tend to soley focus on the trends of covariates and spatial patterning; However, our paper will use these in order to make a risk prediction model
over cardiovascular deaths. 

3) Multiple studies have shwon that CVD mortality is the most prominent in the MidWest and StrokeBelt regions of the US. However, 
regional variation exists for cardiovascular disease. 

4) Our paper takes into account the fact that socioeconomic factors are not constant on a time and space basis, especially with cardiovascular disease 
as it's a much more complex relationship. 

5) The GWR model is better for analyzing disparities at the local-scale, see which socioeconomic factor affects different regions, and 
then implement a policy for that specific region. 

6) There's been a growing popularity for the use of spatial models in the epidemiological domain to analyze the factors and spatial distribution 
of a certain disease. The spatial models and techniques used differ between studies however the end goal remains the same. 

7) Our study strengths include: 
- a) Using CDC data from the years 2015-2018 for the covariates such as age, sex, race, etc
- b) Using a separate dataset for the socioeconomic factors in US counties 
- c) Using a final separate dataset for the air particulate matter in US counties 
- d) By using a GWR model, there's minimal possibility for errors between the actual model the predicted risk model
