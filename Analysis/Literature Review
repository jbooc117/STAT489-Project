******* STRENGTHS OF RESEARCH PAPERS *******

a) Risk prediction models 
b) Studies also have a wide range of covariates 
c) Following studies identify clusters using bandwidths and statistics such as Moran's I (global), LISA (local), and Getis-Ord Gi (local). 
d) By pooling the data over multiple years, this reduces the amount of missing information from smaller counties 


******* WEAKNESSES OF RESEARCH PAPERS *******

a) When using GWR model, multicollinearity is subject to occur. 
b) Spatial and temporal differences on the larger regional/subregional scale is still poorly understood 
c) Hosptilization weaknesses and findings from studies show that there's a misclassification of races outside of white/black. This often happens due to underrreporting.
This suggests the need for better accurate population-based surveillance on races to

            in People with Diabetes in the United States: A Cross-Sectional Anlysis" :
    - Variables: Type 2 diabetes mortality rates, air pollution, social determinants, and county-level data 
    - Correlation found between household income, race, and healthcare access 
    - CDC and Wonder data, cohort study, age-adjusted CVM, GWR model, AIC and R^2
    - Results show that counties in the South had the highest PM2.5 exposure and counties in the Northeast had the lowest 

2. Terry ~ "Trends in Cardiovascular Disease Mortality by County-Level Social Vulnerability Index in the US":
    - Foused on race/sex differences rather than geographical differences 
    - Results suggest an association between the social determinants of health and cardiovascular mortality
    - Wonder data, Social Vulnerability Index, 2-tailed Kruskal-Wallis test, linear regression model

            Million Hospitalization Records": 
    - Examined CVD on the elderly population using hospitalization records; specifically data from 1991-2014, aged 65+ years, and categorized by 
      age/sex/race/state

4. Tabb ~ "Exploring the Spatial Patterning in Racial Differences in Cardiovascular Health Between Blacks and Whites Across the US":
    - Variables: smoking status, BMI, physical activity, blood pressure, blood glocuse levels, and diet 
    - Focus on how much heterogeneity exists in the difference between whites and blacks in the US
    - GWR model, ANOVA F test, adaptive bandwidths

    - Mapping, cluster detection, spatial regression 
    - Detailed sections of the factors associated with cardiovascular disease such as air pollution, socioeconomic status, education level, 
      rural vs urban residency, etc 
    - States that socioeconomic status is an important factor to see access to healthcare services 
    - For spatial analysis, the geographic unit of choice and the size of the area are important factors to take into consideration 
    - In terms of cluster analysis, take into account the number of occurring events, the expected number of events, and the population at risk 

6. Roth ~ "Trends and Patterns of Geographic Variation in Cardiovascular Mortality Among US Counties, 1980-2014": 
    - Overall, there's been a decrease in cardiovascular disease mortality rates in the US on the county-level scale. 
    - Focus of the paper was on the county-level, however nation-level results were used for comparison 
    - Focus of the paper was on trends and clustering of specific heart diseases rather than CVD incidence 


******* LITERATURE REVIEW KEY HIGHLIGHTS *******

1) Above papers are useful for our paper to see the spatial distribution of cardiovascular disease and better understand the geographical differrences 
in relation to air quality and socioeconomic factors on a spatial and temporal basis. This allows policymakers to make the necessary decisions and implement policies.

2) Past studies tend to soley focus on the trends of covariates and spatial patterning; However, our paper will use these in order to make a risk prediction model
over cardiovascular deaths. 

3) Multiple studies have shown that CVD mortality is the most prominent in the MidWest and StrokeBelt regions of the US. However, 
regional variation exists for cardiovascular disease. 

4) Our paper takes into account the fact that socioeconomic factors are not constant on a time and space basis, especially with cardiovascular disease 
as it's a much more complex relationship. 

5) The GWR model is better for analyzing disparities at the local-scale, see which socioeconomic factor affects different regions, and 
then implement a policy for that specific region. 

6) There's been a growing popularity for the use of spatial models in the epidemiological domain to analyze the factors and spatial distribution 
of a certain disease. The spatial models and techniques used differ between studies however the end goal remains the same. 

7) The GWR model shows whether or not a linear relationship exists between cardiovascular disease deaths and the covariates, making it suitable 
to see where the areas of focus should be placed in terms of improvement as well as an increase presence of healthcare practitioners. 

9) As the leading cause of death in the United States, it's important to analyze the geographical distribution of cardiovascular disease deaths, 
determine the strength of its relationship with the covariates air poluution and socioeconomic factors, to make a risk prediction model. 

10) Our study strengths include: 
- a) Using CDC data from the years 2015-2018 for the covariates such as age, sex, race, etc
- b) Using a separate dataset for the socioeconomic factors in US counties 
- c) Using a final separate dataset for the air particulate matter in US counties 
- d) By using a GWR model, there's minimal possibility for errors between the actual model and the predicted risk model 

******* PARAGRAPH OUTLINE *******

Paragraph 1. (Review of regression approaches in cardiovascular disease mortality) >>>> 
     There's been a growing popularity for the use of spatial models in the epidemiological domain to analyze the factors and spatial distribution 
     of a certain disease. The spatial models and techniques used differ between studies however the end goal remains the same. 


Paragraph 2. (Review of geographically weighted regression models) >>>>

Paragraph 3. (GWR with CVD) >>>> 
     The GWR model shows whether or not a linear relationship exists between cardiovascular disease deaths and the covariates, making it suitable 
     to see where the areas of focus should be placed in terms of improvement as well as an increase presence of healthcare practitioners. 
     The GWR model is better for analyzing disparities at the local-scale, see which socioeconomic factor affects different regions, and 
     then implement a policy for that specific region. 


Paragraph 4. (Risk prediction model) >>>>
     Risk assessment and risk estimates helps to understand the key factors associated with CVD.
     Past studies tend to soley focus on the trends of covariates and spatial patterning. However, our paper will use these in order to make a risk prediction model
     over cardiovascular deaths. When using a risk prediction model to make estimates, the following is necessary: reliable data, risk markers, 
     valid statistical methods, and clinical context setting (Lloyd-Jones et. al). As risk prediction models are centered around the population as a whole rather than individuals, 
     we apply our risk prediction model over the 18-44 year-old age group. 


5. Paragraph 5 (Direct comparison with clustering approaches) >>>> 
     With cluster analysis, it's important to take into consideration the number of occurring events, the expected number of events, and the population at risk. 
     Whereas with spatial analysis, factors such as the geographic region of choice and the size of the area are key componenets. 
     Clustering approaches is a suitable method in order to see where the CVD incidence is concentrated. However, Our paper takes into account 
     the fact that socioeconomic factors are not constant on a time and space basis with cardiovascular disease by using a GWR model. as it's a much more complex relationship.
