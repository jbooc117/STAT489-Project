Strengths:
1) Risk prediction models 
2) Range of covariates 
3) Identify clusters using statistics and bandwidths
4) Pool the data over multiple years to reduce missing information from smaller counties 

Weaknesses:
1) Multicollinearity using GWR model 
2) Spatial and temporal differences on the large regional and subregional scale is still poorly understood
3) Oftentimes, there's a misclassification of races outside of white/black 
4) 

Zelko paper:
- Variables: Type 2 diabetes mortality rates, air pollution, social determinants, and county-level data 
- Correlation found between household income, race, and healthcare access 
- CDC and Wonder data, cohort study, age-adjusted CVM, GWR model, AIC and R^2
- Results show that counties in the South had the highest PM2.5 exposure and counties in the Northeast had the lowest 

Terry paper:
- Foused on race/sex differences rather than geographical differences 
- Results suggest an association between the social determinants of health and cardiovascular mortality
- Wonder data, Social Vulnerability Index, 2-tailed Kruskal-Wallis test, linear regression model 

Singh paper:
- Examined CVD on the elderly population 
- Performed data standardization 
- Divide data into batches (differences in algorithms for certain year ranges), 3rd degree polynomial function

Tabb paper:
- Variables: smoking status, BMI, physical activity, blood pressure, blood glocuse levels, and diet 
- Focus on how much heterogeneity exists in the difference between whites and blacks in the US
- GWR model, ANOVA F test, adaptive bandwidths 

Mena paper:
- Mapping, cluster detection, spatial regression 

Draft:
- Above papers are useful for our paper to see the spatial distribution of cardiovascular disease and better understand the geographical differrences 
in relation to air quality and socioeconomic factors for policymakers. 
- Past studies focus on the trends of covariates and spatial patterning; however, our paper will use these in order to make risk prediction model
over cardiovascular deaths 
- Regional variation exists across the US (as seen in the the MidWest and the StrokeBelt regions) 
- Our paper takes into account the fact that socioeconomic factors are not constant on a time and space basis 
- The GWR model is better for local-level disparities in
