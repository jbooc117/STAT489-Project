******* STRENGTHS OF RESEARCH PAPERS *******

a) Risk prediction models 
b) Studies also have a wide range of covariates 
c) Following studies identify clusters using bandwidths and statistics such as Moran's I (global), LISA (local), and Getis-Ord Gi (local).

******* WEAKNESSES OF RESEARCH PAPERS *******

a) When using GWR model, multicollinearity is subject to occur. 
b) Spatial and temporal differences on the larger regional/subregional scale is still poorly understood 
c) Hosptilization weaknesses and findings from studies show that there's a misclassification of races outside of white/black. This often happens due to underrreporting.
This suggests the need for better accurate population-based surveillance on races to

******* LITERATURE REVIEW KEY HIGHLIGHTS *******

1) Above papers are useful for our paper to see the spatial distribution of cardiovascular disease and better understand the geographical differrences 
in relation to air quality and socioeconomic factors on a spatial and temporal basis. This allows policymakers to make the necessary decisions and implement policies.

2) Past studies tend to soley focus on the trends of covariates and spatial patterning; However, our paper will use these in order to make a risk prediction model
over cardiovascular deaths. 

3) Multiple studies have shown that CVD mortality is the most prominent in the MidWest and StrokeBelt regions of the US. However, 
regional variation exists for cardiovascular disease. 

4) Our paper takes into account the fact that socioeconomic factors are not constant on a time and space basis, especially with cardiovascular disease 
as it's a much more complex relationship. 

5) The GWR model is better for analyzing disparities at the local-scale, see which socioeconomic factor affects different regions, and 
then implement a policy for that specific region. 

6) There's been a growing popularity for the use of spatial models in the epidemiological domain to analyze the factors and spatial distribution 
of a certain disease. The spatial models and techniques used differ between studies however the end goal remains the same. 

7) The GWR model shows whether or not a linear relationship exists between cardiovascular disease deaths and the covariates, making it suitable 
to see where the areas of focus should be placed in terms of improvement as well as an increase presence of healthcare practitioners. 

9) As the leading cause of death in the United States, it's important to analyze the geographical distribution of cardiovascular disease deaths, 
determine the strength of its relationship with the covariates air poluution and socioeconomic factors, to curate the necessary risk preventative measures.  

10) Our study strengths include: 
- a) Using CDC data from the years 2015-2018 for the covariates such as age, sex, race, etc
- b) Using a separate dataset for the socioeconomic factors in US counties 
- c) Using a final separate dataset for the air particulate matter in US counties 
- d) By using a GWR model, there's minimal possibility for errors between the actual model and the predicted risk model 

******* PARAGRAPH OUTLINE *******

Paragraph 1. (Review of regression approaches in cardiovascular disease mortality) >>>> 
     There's been a growing popularity for the use of spatial models in the epidemiological domain to analyze the factors and spatial distribution 
     of a certain disease. The spatial models and techniques used differ between studies however the end goal remains the same, reduce the disease 
     mortality rates for the population. Statistical regression models have been a popular choice, specifically for CVD-related studies. The factors 
     that compromise the underlying causes for CVD can be seen as a dynamic and interconnected web. Zelko et. al examines the relationship 
     between CVD and covariates similar to our study, such as air pollution, social determinants, and county-level data. By using a GWR model,
     they found a correlation between household income, race, and healthcare access. Their results also showed that counties in the South had 
     the highest PM 2.5 concentrations. 

Paragraph 2. (Review of geographically weighted regression models) >>>>
     The geographically weighted regression model (GWR) stands out from the traditional regression models to explore spatial data by doing so
     on the local scale as well as taking into account varied coefficients for a certain spatial unit (Gebread et. al). The GWR model uses the 
     weighted least square method to estimate the regression coefficients. In general, we are interested in seeing values closer to the point of 
     interest than values farther from it, as they carry more weight and have a greater influence. The GWR model includes the parameter, neighborhood 
     (also known as the bandwidth). 

Paragraph 3. (Direct comparison with OLS approaches) >>>> 
     As seen in other studies, the Ordinary Least Squares model is a popular method for public health studies. Compared to the GWR model, 
     the OLS model generates the regression coefficients on a global scale. Because of this, the OLS method may not be the ideal choice. 
     as it is prone to hidden spatial variability. However, our paper takes into account the fact that socioeconomic factors are not 
     constant on a time and space basis with cardiovascular disease by using a GWR model, as it's a much more complex relationship. That's not
     to say the OLS model has no use in epidemiological research studies. One of the main goals of public health is to better the population as 
     a whole. The OLS model is efficient in capturing the average differences between covariates. To get to the root cause of CVD mortality rates,
     we need to start with the GRW model, to see overall improvement in the OLS model later on. 

Paragraph 4. (GWR with CVD) >>>> 
     The GWR model shows whether or not a linear relationship exists between cardiovascular disease deaths and the covariates, making it suitable 
     to see where the areas of focus should be placed in terms of improvement as well as an increase presence of healthcare practitioners. 
     The GWR model is better for analyzing disparities at the local-scale, see which socioeconomic factor affects different regions, and 
     then implement a policy for that specific region. Past studies tend to soley focus on the trends of socioeconomic covariates and its 
     spatial patterning. Our paper expands on past studies, by including the concentration of air pollutants as one of our covariates. By doing so,
     we are able to fully explore the dynamic relationship between geographical units and CVD incidence/mortality rates. 
     
Paragraph 5. (Preventative risk measures + impact) >>>>
     Risk assessment and risk estimates helps to understand the key factors associated with CVD. The concentration of specific races 
     vary by counties so by studying the underlying socioeconomic covariates of CVD mortality on the county-level, researchers and health 
     practitioners are thus able to curate the necessary risk preventative measures and allocate resources to the areas that need it the most. 
     Furthermore, the dose-response relationship of air pollutant concentrations in a region and its effects can be analyzed. By putting the focus on 
     smaller units, CVD-mortality rates will start to see a decline, nationally and globally.
