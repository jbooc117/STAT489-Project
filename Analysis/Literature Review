Strengths:
1) Risk prediction models 
2) Range of covariates 
3) Identify clusters using statistics and bandwidths
4) Pool the data over multiple years to reduce missing information from smaller counties 

Weaknesses:
1) Multicollinearity using GWR model 
2) Spatial and temporal differences on the large regional and subregional scale is still poorly understood
3) Oftentimes, there's a misclassification of races outside of white/black 
4) 

Zelko paper:
- Variables: air pollution, social determinants, Type 2 diabetes mortality rates, and county-level data 
- Correlation found between household income, race, and healthcare access 
- CDC and Wonder data, cohort study, age-adjusted CVM, GWR model, AIC and R^2

Terry paper:
- Foused on race/sex differences rather than geographical differences 
- Results suggest an association between the social determinants of health and cardiovascular mortality
- Wonder data, Social Vulnerability Index, 2-tailed Kruskal-Wallis test, linear regression model 

Singh paper:
- Examined CVD on the elderly population 
- Performed data standardization 
- Divide data into batches (differences in algorithms for certain year ranges), 3rd degree polynomial function

Tabb paper:
- Variables: smoking status, BMI, physical activity, blood pressure, blood glocuse levels, and diet 
- Focus on how much heterogeneity exists in the difference between whites and blacks in the US
- GWR model, ANOVA F test, adaptive bandwidths 

Mena paper:
- Mapping, cluster detection, spatial regression
