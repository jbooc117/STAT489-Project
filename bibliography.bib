	abstract = {Background
U.S. urban air quality has improved dramatically over the past decades. We evaluated acute effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on cardiovascular (CVD) mortality among residents of Allegheny County in SW Pennsylvania (1999–2011) using spatio-temporal modeling of air pollutants (AP) to reduce misclassification error in exposure assessment.
Methods
Spatio-temporal kriging of daily PM2.5 and ozone (O3) was used to produce daily exposure estimates at the residence ZIP code. Time-stratified case-crossover analysis was conducted to examine short-term effects of PM2.5 on CVD mortality, adjusting for O3 and apparent mean temperature. We studied both single and distributed lags for days 0–5. All CVD mortality and subcategories of ischemic heart disease (IHD), acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia were examined.
Results
A total of 62,135 deaths were identified. We found significant associations of PM2.5 with IHD and PVD mortality at lag day 5: (2.1\% (95\% CI, 0.2–4.1\%) and (7.6\%, 95\% CI, 0.05–15.7\%) per 10µg/m3 increase of PM2.5 in single lag models and for IHD in distributed lag models. There were no statistically significant associations with PM2.5 for any of the other outcomes.
Conclusions
The application of finer scale geographically resolved AP exposures made it possible to study acute effects of PM2.5 on CVD mortality in a large metropolitan area. Our study results demonstrated the continued presence of a dose response relationship of increased risk of CVD mortality within this lower range of PM2.5 exposure.},

However, few studies consider measurement error and spatial effects in the estimate of underlying air pollution levels, and less is known about the influence of baseline air pollution levels on cardiovascular disease. We used hospital admissions data for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) collected from an inland, heavily polluted city and a coastal city in Shandong Province, China. Bayesian spatio-temporal models were applied to obtain the underlying pollution level in each city, then generalized additive models were adopted to assess the health effects. The total cardiovascular disease hospitalizations were significantly increased in the inland city by 0.401\% (0.029, 0.775), 0.316\% (0.086, 0.547), 0.903\% (0.252, 1.559), and 2.647\% (1.607, 3.697) per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2, respectively. The total cardiovascular diseases hospitalizations were increased by 6.568\% (3.636, 9.584) per 10μg/m3 increase in the level of NO2. Although the air pollution overall had a more significant adverse impact on cardiovascular disease hospital admissions in the heavily polluted inland city, the short-term increases in air pollution levels in the less polluted coastal areas led to excessive exacerbations of cardiovascular disease.},

These techniques, enabling recognition of events at different geographical levels of study (e.g., rural, deprived neighbourhoods, etc.), make it possible to relate CVDs to factors present in the immediate environment. The systemic literature presented here shows that this group of diseases is clustered with regard to incidence, mortality and hospitalization as well as obesity, smoking, increased glycated haemoglobin levels, hypertension physical activity and age. In addition, acquired variables such as income, residency (rural or urban) and education, contribute to CVD clustering. Both local cluster detection and spatial regression techniques give statistical weight to the findings providing valuable information that can influence response mechanisms in the health services by indicating locations in need of intervention and assignment of available resources.},

	abstract = {There is little known about the global burden of CVD attributable to ambient PM2.5 (referred to as CVD burden hereinafter) and its secular trend across different regions and countries. We aimed to evaluate the spatiotemporal trends in CVD burden at the global, regional and national levels from 1990 to 2019. Data on CVD burden including mortality and disability adjusted of life years (DALYs) from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Cases, the age-standardized rate of mortality (ASMR) and DALYs (ASDR) were estimated by age, sex and sociodemographic index (SDI). Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to evaluate the temporal changing in ASDR and ASMR from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, 2.48 million deaths and 60.91 million DALYs of CVD were attributed to ambient PM2.5 globally. Most CVD burden occurred in males, elderly and the middle SDI region. At national level, Uzbekistan, Egypt, and Iraq had the highest ASMR and ASDR. Despite remarkable increase in number of DALYs and deaths of CVD worldwide from 1990 to 2019, we observed nonsignificant change in ASMR (EAPC: 0.06, 95 \% CI: −0.01, 0.13) and slight increment in ASDR (EAPC: 0.30, 95 \% CI: 0.23, 0.37). The EAPCs of ASMR and ASDR were negatively associated with SDI in 2019, while the low-middle SDI region exhibited the fastest growth of ASMR and ASDR with EAPCs of 3.25 (95 \% CI: 3.14, 3.37) and 3.36 (95 \% CI: 3.22, 3.49), respectively. In conclusion, the global CVD burden attributable to ambient PM2.5 has largely increased over the past three decades. The population growth, aging and SDI contributed to the heterogeneity of spatial and temporal distribution. Enforcing policy to improving air quality is required to halt the growing burden of PM2.5 on health.},

	abstract = {Background
              The US population is aging, with concurrent increases in cardiovascular disease (CVD) burdens; however, spatiotemporal and demographic trends in CVD incidence in the US elderly have not been investigated in detail. This study aims to characterize trends from 1991 to 2014 in CVD hospitalizations among US Medicare beneficiaries, aged 65+ years, by single year of age/sex/race/state using records from the US Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid, covering 98\% of older Americans.
            
            
              Methods and Results
              We abstracted 181 202 758 US Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid hospitalization records indicating CVD in any of 10 diagnosis codes; tabulated total cases of CVD by sex, age, race, state, and calendar year (1991–2014); and normalized hospitalization counts to standardize over data batches. Stratum‐specific hospitalization rates were calculated using US Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid records and US Census population counts; a cubic polynomial function was fit to year‐specific distributions of rates by single year of age. Nationwide, CVD‐related hospitalization rates increased from 1991 to 2014. Differences between hospitalization rates at age 65 and 66 years, representing magnitude of healthcare deferral until Medicare onset, increased by 7.49 per 100 people 1991 to 2006 overall, and were largest among blacks and Native Americans. Rates of CVD hospitalizations were consistently highest in the Midwest/Deep South. Evidence of misclassification of race/ethnicity in US Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid hospitalization records in the 1990s was noted.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Trends in CVD‐related hospitalization rates among older Americans highlight the essential need for targeted policies to reduce CVD burdens, to improve reporting of race/ethnicity in large administrative databases, and to enhance access to affordable healthcare.},

	abstract = {Background
              Existing studies on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) often focus on individual‐level behavioral risk factors, but research examining social determinants is limited. This study applies a novel machine learning approach to identify the key predictors of county‐level care costs and prevalence of CVDs (including atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease).
            
            
              Methods and Results
              
                We applied the extreme gradient boosting machine learning approach to a total of 3137 counties. Data are from the
                Interactive Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke
                and a variety of national data sets. We found that although demographic composition (eg, percentages of Black people and older adults) and risk factors (eg, smoking and physical inactivity) are among the most important predictors for inpatient care costs and CVD prevalence, contextual factors such as social vulnerability and racial and ethnic segregation are particularly important for the total and outpatient care costs. Poverty and income inequality are the major contributors to the total care costs for counties that are in nonmetro areas or have high segregation or social vulnerability levels. Racial and ethnic segregation is particularly important in shaping the total care costs for counties with low poverty rates or social vulnerability level. Demographic composition, education, and social vulnerability are consistently important across different scenarios.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              The findings highlight the differences in predictors for different types of CVD cost outcomes and the importance of social determinants. Interventions directed toward areas that have been economically and socially marginalized may aid in reducing the impact of CVDs.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models such as random forests (RF) have been widely applied in the field of road safety. RF is a prominent algorithm, overcoming the limitations of using a single decision tree such as overfitting and instability. However, the traditional RF is a global concept, and thus may fail to capture spatial variability. In macro-level analysis of road safety, the relationship between crash frequency and risk factors can vary spatially. To address this issue, we employ a modified RF algorithm, named geographically weighted random forest (GWRF). Based on the data from London at the level of Middle-super-output-area (MSOA), the predictive performances of RF and GWRF are compared using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Moreover, considering MSOAs are geographically connected with each other, several factors related to the discrepancies between adjacent zones are also included in the models. Our results indicate that GWRF outperforms the traditional RF and GWR when an appropriate bandwidth is selected. We further explore the effects of multicollinearity on model performance. The results show that prediction accuracy of GWRF models are not susceptible to the multicollinearity. However, the importance values of those variables with multicollinearity may reduce. Finally, and of equal importance, it is found that the importance of each explanatory variable varies across zones. The density of minor road makes the highest contribution to crash frequency in downtown area, while the crash frequency in peripheral area is more sensitive to the discrepancy of road environment between MSOAs. With such information, road safety interventions can be designed and implemented according to the locally important factors, avoiding thus general guidelines addressed for the entire city.},

Changing to 10\% CO2/90\% 02 on both surfaces doubles the acid secretory rate. We calculate that, were the rate of oxygen consumption to increase significantly as a result of secretory stimulation, the tissue would now be oxygen limited. This prediction is tested by raising the P02 by increasing the total pressure in a hyperbaric chamber. Since no change in acid secretory rate or potential difference was observed upon changing from PO2 = 0.9 to PO2 = 1.9 atm, we conclude that the tissue is not O2 limited at normal pressure. Decreasing PO2 below 0.9 atm, by contrast, decreases the acid secretory rate and raises both PD and resistance. We infer that the rate of oxygen consumption did not rise significantly when acid secretion was increased by supplying sufficient CO2.},

            Whether cardiovascular risk scores geographically aggregate and inform on spatial development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) remains unknown. Our aim is to determine the spatial distribution of 10-year predicted cardiovascular risk and ASCVD, and to compare the overlap of the resulting spatial distributions. Using prospective data from the CoLaus{\textbar}PsyCoLaus cohort study (2003–2021) we computed SCORE2 in participants free from ASCVD. Geographical distributions of predicted risk and events were determined using the Gi* Getis-Ord autocorrelation statistic. 6203 individuals (54\% women, mean age 52.5 ± SD 10.7, ASCVD incidence rate 5.7\%) were included. We identified clusters of high versus low predicted risk (4\%, 6\%, respectively) and ASCVD (5\%, 5\% respectively) at baseline. They persisted at follow-up. Overlap of SCORE2 and ASCVD clusters was marginal. Body-mass index and alcohol consumption explained most of the predicted risk distribution. For ASCVD, high clusters persisted or were reinforced after multivariate adjustment, while low incidence clusters were reduced, multifactorial determinants. Incidence rate of ASCVD was 2.5\% higher (IC 95\%, 1.4–3.7) in clusters of higher incidence of ASCVD. To develop up-to-date, geographically targeted prevention strategies, there is a need to study novel geographically risk factors affecting ASCVD and to update commonly used prediction models for a population approach.},

	abstract = {In the United States, regional variation in cardiovascular mortality is well-known but county-level estimates for all major cardiovascular conditions have not been produced.To estimate age-standardized mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases by county.Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics and population counts from the US Census Bureau, the National Center for Health Statistics, and the Human Mortality Database from 1980 through 2014 were used. Validated small area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from all cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation and flutter, rheumatic heart disease, aortic aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease, endocarditis, and all other cardiovascular diseases combined.The 3110 counties of residence.Age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cause.From 1980 to 2014, cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death in the United States, although the mortality rate declined from 507.4 deaths per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 252.7 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2014, a relative decline of 50.2\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 49.5\%-50.8\%). In 2014, cardiovascular diseases accounted for more than 846 000 deaths (95\% UI, 827-865 thousand deaths) and 11.7 million years of life lost (95\% UI, 11.6-11.9 million years of life lost). The gap in age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates between counties at the 10th and 90th percentile declined 14.6\% from 172.1 deaths per 100 000 persons in 1980 to 147.0 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2014 (posterior probability of decline \&gt;99.9\%). In 2014, the ratio between counties at the 90th and 10th percentile was 2.0 for ischemic heart disease (119.1 vs 235.7 deaths per 100 000 persons) and 1.7 for cerebrovascular disease (40.3 vs 68.1 deaths per 100 000 persons). For other cardiovascular disease causes, the ratio ranged from 1.4 (aortic aneurysm: 3.5 vs 5.1 deaths per 100 000 persons) to 4.2 (hypertensive heart disease: 4.3 vs 17.9 deaths per 100 000 persons). The largest concentration of counties with high cardiovascular disease mortality extended from southeastern Oklahoma along the Mississippi River Valley to eastern Kentucky. Several cardiovascular disease conditions were clustered substantially outside the South, including atrial fibrillation (Northwest), aortic aneurysm (Midwest), and endocarditis (Mountain West and Alaska). The lowest cardiovascular mortality rates were found in the counties surrounding San Francisco, California, central Colorado, northern Nebraska, central Minnesota, northeastern Virginia, and southern Florida.Substantial differences exist between county ischemic heart disease and stroke mortality rates. Smaller differences exist for diseases of the myocardium, atrial fibrillation, aortic and peripheral arterial disease, rheumatic heart disease, and endocarditis.},

	abstract = {Background—
              Although many studies have documented the dramatic declines in heart disease mortality in the United States at the national level, little attention has been given to the temporal changes in the geographic patterns of heart disease mortality.
            
            
              Methods and Results—
              
                Age-adjusted and spatially smoothed county-level heart disease death rates were calculated for 2-year intervals from 1973 to 1974 to 2009 to 2010 for those aged ≥35 years. Heart disease deaths were defined according to the
                International Classification of Diseases
                codes for diseases of the heart in the eighth, ninth, and tenth revisions of the
                International Classification of Diseases
                . A fully Bayesian spatiotemporal model was used to produce precise rate estimates, even in counties with small populations. A substantial shift in the concentration of high-rate counties from the Northeast to the Deep South was observed, along with a concentration of slow-decline counties in the South and a nearly 2-fold increase in the geographic inequality among counties.
              
            
            
              Conclusions—
              The dramatic change in the geographic patterns of heart disease mortality during 40 years highlights the importance of small-area surveillance to reveal patterns that are hidden at the national level, gives communities the historical context for understanding their current burden of heart disease, and provides important clues for understanding the determinants of the geographic disparities in heart disease mortality.},

	abstract = {Background Although cardiovascular mortality (CVM) rates in the United States have been declining overall, our study evaluated whether this holds true for areas with increased social deprivation. Methods and Results We used county-level cross-sectional age-adjusted CVM rates (aa-CVM) (2000-2019) linked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (SVI-2010). We grouped counties as per SVI (Groups I 0-0.2, II 0.21-0.4, III 0.41-0.6, IV 0.61-0.8, and V 0.81-1) and calculated the relative change in the aa-CVM between 2000 to 2003 and 2016 to 2019. We used adjusted linear regression analyses to explore the association between a higher SVI and temporal aa-CVM improvement; we studied this temporal change in aa-CVM across subgroups of race, sex, and location. The median aa-CVM rate (per 100 000) was 272.6 (interquartile range [IQR]: 237.5-311.7). The aa-CVM was higher in men (315.6 [IQR: 273.4-363.9]) than women (221.3 [IQR: 189.6-256.7]), and in Black residents (347.2 [IQR: 301.1-391.1]; P{\textless}0.001) than White residents (258.9 [IQR: 226-299.1]; P{\textless}0.001). The aa-CVM for SVI I (233.6 [IQR: 214.8-257.0]) was significantly lower than that of group V (323.6 [IQR: 277.2-359.2]; P{\textless}0.001). The relative reduction in CVM was significantly higher for SVI group I (32.2\% [IQR: 24.2-38.4]) than group V (27.2\% [IQR: 19-34.1]) counties. After multivariable adjustment, a higher SVI index was associated with lower relative improvement in the age-adjusted CVM (model coefficient -3.11 [95\% CI, -5.66 to -1.22]; P{\textless}0.001). Conclusions Socially deprived counties in the United States had higher aa-CVM rates, and the improvement in aa-CVM over the past 20 years was lower in these counties.},

	abstract = {The association between visit‐to‐visit systolic blood pressure variability and cardiovascular events has recently received a lot of attention in the cardiovascular literature. But, blood pressure variability is usually estimated on a person‐by‐person basis and is therefore subject to considerable measurement error. We demonstrate that hazard ratios estimated using this approach are subject to bias due to regression dilution, and we propose alternative methods to reduce this bias: a two‐stage method and a joint model. For the two‐stage method, in stage one, repeated measurements are modelled using a mixed effects model with a random component on the residual standard deviation (SD). The mixed effects model is used to estimate the blood pressure SD for each individual, which, in stage two, is used as a covariate in a time‐to‐event model. For the joint model, the mixed effects submodel and time‐to‐event submodel are fitted simultaneously using shared random effects. We illustrate the methods using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.},

This study examines the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and chronic disease burden among African Americans compared to Caucasians in a population of higher socioeconomic status.

Design
The current study is a cross-sectional, secondary data analysis of the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study.

Setting
Patients with a medical examination from 1970-2010 at the Cooper Clinic.

Participants
762 African Americans and 40,051 Caucasians who met the criteria.

Outcome Measures
Racial differences in cardiovascular risk factors/burden of disease between African Americans and Caucasians.

Results
African Americans had higher prevalence of evaluated cardiovascular risk factors than did Caucasians after controlling for obesity, tobacco use, and physical fitness. Caucasians had greater likelihood of no risk factors while African Americans were more likely to have all three risk factors. Race was typically predictive of cardiovascular risk factors in African Americans compared to Caucasians.

Conclusions
Findings suggest that health differences persist despite greater socioeconomic status, and further investigations of biopsychosocial causes are warranted. (Ethn Dis. 2013;23[1]:35-42)},

                Cardiovascular health (
                CVH
                ) disparities between blacks and whites have persisted in the United States for some time, and although there have been remarkable improvements in addressing cardiovascular disease, it still remains the leading cause of death in the United States. In addition, well‐documented disparities are unfortunately widening incidence gaps across certain regions of the United States. Our focus was on answering the following questions: (1) How much spatial heterogeneity exists in the racial differences in
                CVH
                between blacks and whites across this country? and (2) Is the spatial heterogeneity in the racial differences significantly explained by living in the Stroke Belt?
              
            
            
              Methods and Results
              
                To explore the spatial patterning in the racial differences in
                CVH
                between blacks and whites across the country, we used geographically weighted regression methods, which result in local estimates of the racial differences in
                CVH
                . Using data from the REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) Study, we found significant spatial patterning in these racial differences, even beyond the well‐known Stroke Belt and Stroke Buckle. All of the estimated differences indicated blacks consistently having diminishing
                CVH
                compared with whites, where this difference was largely noted in pockets of the Stroke Belt and Stroke Buckle, in addition to moderate to large disparities noted in the Great Lakes region, portions of the Northeast, and along the West coast.

	abstract = {Background and Objective. Current cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk models are typically based on traditional laboratory-based predictors. The objective of this research was to identify key risk factors that affect the CVD risk prediction and to develop a 10-year CVD risk prediction model using the identified risk factors. Methods. A Cox proportional hazard regression method was applied to generate the proposed risk model. We used the dataset from Framingham Original Cohort of 5079 men and women aged 30-62 years, who had no overt symptoms of CVD at the baseline; among the selected cohort 3189 had a CVD event. Results. A 10-year CVD risk model based on multiple risk factors (such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, systolic blood pressure (SBP), cigarettes per day, pulse rate, and diabetes) was developed in which heart rate was identified as one of the novel risk factors. The proposed model achieved a good discrimination and calibration ability with C-index (receiver operating characteristic (ROC)) being 0.71 in the validation dataset. We validated the model via statistical and empirical validation. Conclusion. The proposed CVD risk prediction model is based on standard risk factors, which could help reduce the cost and time required for conducting the clinical/laboratory tests. Healthcare providers, clinicians, and patients can use this tool to see the 10-year risk of CVD for an individual. Heart rate was incorporated as a novel predictor, which extends the predictive ability of the past existing risk equations.},
